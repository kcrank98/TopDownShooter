# TopDownShooter

this was a project my classmate, Logan Moyers, and I worked on for about a month.
our goal was to make a simple top down shooter with procedural maps in UE5.

i mostly worked on the procedural generation and the enemy AI.
Logan worked on the player character along with the UI and SFX
